# My open-source experience

Jeremy Lardenois

## Introduction

Hello, I'm Jeremy Lardenois, a french student in computer science. I'm currently in my 5rd year of engineering school, at [Polytech Montpellier](https://www.polytech.umontpellier.fr/), in DevOps and I'm doing my apprenticeship at [PixelsCoder](https://www.pixelscoder.com/).

## My projects

During my studies, I worked on several projects. Here are some of them where I contributed. Globally, I'm interested in Rust and Web development, but I also like to work on all kinds of projects.

### [Diesel](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel)

Diesel is a Safe, Extensible ORM and Query Builder for Rust. This project is the first one than I run into an open-source community. On this project, I'm part of the review team. I also contributed to the documentation. This experience was very interesting because I learned a lot about the Rust ecosystem, what is really an orm, the open-source community and what is a real open-source project. I would like to thank the whole team for their help and their kindness.

- State of the project: **on production**
- Community: **active**
- Stack: **Rust, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite**

### [Githut](https://github.com/madnight/githut)

Githut is a web application that allows you to visualize data on languages used on Github. It is built with React and Javascript. I consider this project as my first real open-source contribution by myself. I worked on the frontend in order to add the possibility to export the data in CSV and JSON format embedded in a zip file.

### [Rik](https://github.com/rik-org/rik)

RIK is an experimental workload orchestrator written in Rust that aims to be able to natively schedule containers and virtual machines workloads. RIK stands for Rust in Kubernetes. It was made for a school project at Polytech Montpellier in my 3rd year of "École d'ingénieur". I worked mainly on the network part of the project. This project is now also a base for a new project called PolyXia.

- State of the project: **experimental**
- Community: **not very active**
- Stack: **Rust**

### [Polyxia](https://github.com/polyxia-org/)

Polyxia is a voice assistant project created by DevOps students at Polytech Montpellier that includes a FaaS architecture based on Rik and Firecracker. I worked mainly on the cli part of the project. This project is still in development.

- State of the project: **experimental, in development**
- Community: **not started**
- Stack: **Rust, Go**

### Other side contributions

I also contributed to other projects, but I didn't work on them a lot. Here are some of them:

#### [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings)

A list of useful payloads and bypasses for Web Application Security. Feel free to improve with your payloads and techniques. I contributed to the project by fixing the documentation on metasploit that was broken.

- State of the project: **on production**
- Community: **active**
- Stack: **Markdown**

#### [ip_logger](https://github.com/JeremyLARDENOIS/ip_logger)

`ip_logger` is a simple tool that allows you to log all the IP addresses that are connected to your network.

#### [Pokemon Python](https://github.com/JeremyLARDENOIS/Pokemon-Python)

Originally a project to show my skills and my passion for programming, Pokemon Python is a mini-game versus in network using raw-socket based on shi-fu-mi. I worked on the project during my 2nd year in "DUT" of networks and telecommunications. I worked on the project alone, and deserves me to try new things that I learned in Python This project is now on hold.
